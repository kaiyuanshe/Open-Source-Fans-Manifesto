# Open Source Fans Manifesto

* [中文版](README.md)
* English version

We are a group of open source enthusiasts and believers, and we believe that open source represents a power for good!  As a worldwide movement sweeping the world, more than 20 years of history has proven that open source can not only breed the latest technology and create better software, but also help make the world a better place.

Dissecting the meaning of open source and understanding the spirit of open source allows us to understand why open source can make the world a better place. In our view, the spirit of open source is manifested in the following aspects.

* **Sharing**

When a software engineer writes a good software, he is not self-privileged or self-styled. He is willing to share it because he believes that the software may help others, and that they will help him to make a better software. As the western proverb goes, "Give a rose to someone, leave a fragrance in your hand. We all believe: **The willingness to share is the beginning of all good deeds.**

* **openness**

In many ways, openness is important. Not just open source, but also open and transparent communities. Such a community can attract more people to join. It can also help newcomers to understand and agree with the rules of the community. It also promotes oversight to improve the procedural justice with which the community operates. Openness also includes welcoming all possibilities, as open source is universal, and users, participants, and contributors from anywhere in the world are welcome. There is a Chinese proverb that says: "All rivers run in the sea, and there is capacity for greatness. We all believe that: **Openness and transparency are the cornerstones of all good collaboration.**

* **Equality**

We welcome any and all contributions from anyone, and we judge each code or documentation submission equally on the basis of a single set of criteria: the quality and value of the code or documentation itself, not the contributor's education, age, race, gender, or position. We're all created equal, so we believe that: **the pursuit of equality is a guarantee of community health.**

* **Collaboration**

Collaboration in an open source community begins with the acceptance of small contributions, and an open community embraces open collaboration. Such collaboration doesn't start after the entire community has reached consensus, but welcomes every bit of improvement from everyone. As the old Chinese saying goes: If you don't accumulate small streams, you can't make a river and a sea. We all believe that: **Open collaboration, building consensus over time, is the secret to community prosperity.**

* **Build a better world**

Everyone who devotes to open source is an idealist to a greater or lesser extent. We all believe that this imperfect world deserves to be better. We all believe that we can make the world a better place through our own technology and open source methods. We believe even more: the spirit of open source, should be promoted to more areas. Because: **Build a better world, is the ultimate pursuit of open source.**

Our friends in the open source community believe in the power of starting with me, so we are issuing the following call to action.

* **Advocate widely**

We should work harder to spread the idea and spirit of open source to the public, so that more people accept the idea of open source and become fellow open source practitioners. We should also promote the practice of open source in areas other than open source software and open source hardware, not just open source, but also open data, open knowledge, open all the knowledge and experience that can help the world become better, so that more industries and more groups, all accept open source and become the beneficiaries of open collaboration.

* **Help each other**

We should help more open source projects to grow and develop. Help the various open source communities to bring the community together and work together. We should also prevent the meaning of open source from being misused or misinterpreted. We need to prevent fragmentation, artificial barriers, and "pseudo-open source" with any discriminatory clauses, to ensure that open source remains a globally beneficial cause.

* **Just do it**

Everyone can participate in open source, not just the big guys. We can start by translating or writing documentation, correcting spelling, debugging code, reviewing code, submitting code, volunteering to support open source events, and we can also preach and speak to attract more people to join us.

**summing up**

In the face of a world that is changing rapidly, sinking rapidly, and may even become torn apart, it is all the more important for us to promote the spirit of open source, to gather the wisdom of all people for good, to be open and collaborative, mutually beneficial and win-win, and to contribute to a better world.
